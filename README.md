# Adomas Server List for the homework assignment

The App contains a Login, Logout and Server List pages. It's using React, React Router, Redux Toolkit, RTK query, Tailwind, Vite, Vitest and Cypress for the mayor part of the tech stack. We can happily discuss the choices later on ;).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Starts the development server using Vite. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production using TypeScript Compiler (tsc) followed by Vite build. The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

### `npm run lint`

Lints the project using ESLint, checking all `.ts` and `.tsx` files. It reports unused disable directives and fails on any warnings.

### `npm run preview`

Allows you to preview the built project locally, mimicking a production setup.

### `npm run format`

Formats the codebase using Prettier, writing the changes directly to the files.

### `npm run format:check`

Checks the codebase's formatting with Prettier, ensuring consistency across the codebase without making any changes.

### `npm run test`

Runs the tests using Vite's test runner, Vitest.

### `npm run test:coverage`

Runs the tests using Vitest and also produces a coverage report.

## Cypress Testing

To run Cypress tests, you can use the following command:

### `npx cypress open`

This will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can run your Cypress tests interactively.

If you aren't familiar with cypress, when opened, select 'E2E testing' and then Electron, then test suites should appear and you can watch them through the Cypress client

## Installing Dependencies

Before running any of the above scripts, make sure to install the necessary dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install
```
